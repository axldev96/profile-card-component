## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me mainly with the use of several images as background, the most complicated thing was to position them because there were many things that I did not know.

### Continued development

I will try to learn more about the positioning, units of measurement and sizes that the backgrounds can have.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs | background-image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) - Very useful information about the use of backgrounds in css.
